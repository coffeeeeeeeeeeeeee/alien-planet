This is a side project programmed with help of newly presented Gemini 2.5 AI.
It was made using Google AI Studio suite for image and programming.
Just to clarify, I know a little bit about Javascript, HTML and CSS.
Not all features were made using AI, just the core systems programming.
A little library called Js2d was formerly coded by me, and then used AI to do the game.
